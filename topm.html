However, Thorfinn is not part of the group for the plunder it entails—instead, for having caused his family great tragedy, the boy has vowed to kill Askeladd in a fair duel. Not yet skilled enough to defeat him, but unable to abandon his vengeance, Thorfinn spends his boyhood with the mercenary crew, honing his skills on the battlefield among the war-loving Danes, where killing is just another pleasure of life.<br /><br />One day, when Askeladd receives word that Danish prince Canute has been taken hostage, he hatches an ambitious plot—one that will decide the next King of England and drastically alter the lives of Thorfinn, Canute, and himself. Set in 11th-century Europe,&nbsp;<i>Vinland Saga</i>&nbsp;tells a bloody epic in an era where violence, madness, and injustice are inescapable, providing a paradise for the battle-crazed and utter hell for the rest who live in it.</span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span itemprop="description" style="background-color: white; font-family: Verdana, Arial; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1.5em; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; text-align: left;"><br /></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span itemprop="description" style="background-color: white; font-family: Verdana, Arial; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1.5em; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; text-align: left;"><br /></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span itemprop="description" style="background-color: white; font-family: Verdana, Arial; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1.5em; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; text-align: left;"><br /></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span itemprop="description" style="background-color: white; font-family: Verdana, Arial; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1.5em; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; text-align: left;"><br /></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><b style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: x-large; text-align: left;"></b></div><b style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: x-large;">9.&nbsp;</b><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: large;"><b>Oyasumi Punpun</b></span><div><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: large;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/3/266834.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="318" data-original-width="225" height="318" src="https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/3/266834.jpg" width="225" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div><h2 style="background-color: white; border-color: rgb(190, 190, 190); border-style: solid; border-width: 0px 0px 1px; font-family: Verdana, Arial; font-size: 12px; margin: 4px 0px 5px; padding: 3px 0px;">Synopsis</h2><span itemprop="description" style="background-color: white; font-family: Verdana, Arial; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1.5em; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Punpun Onodera is a normal 11-year-old boy living in Japan. Hopelessly idealistic and romantic, Punpun begins to see his life take a subtle—though nonetheless startling—turn to the adult when he meets the new girl in his class, Aiko Tanaka. It is then that the quiet boy learns just how fickle maintaining a relationship can be, and the surmounting difficulties of transitioning from a naïve boyhood to a convoluted adulthood. When his father assaults his mother one night, Punpun realizes another thing: those whom he looked up to were not as impressive as he once thought.<br /><br />As his problems increase, Punpun's once shy demeanor turns into voluntary reclusiveness. Rather than curing him of his problems and conflicting emotions, this merely intensifies them, sending him down the dark path of maturity in this grim coming-of-age saga.<br /></span></div><b><div><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: large;"><b><br /></b></span></div><div><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: large;"><b><br /></b></span></div><div><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: large;"><b><br /></b></span></div></b></span><div><b style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: x-large;"><br /></b></div><div><b style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: x-large;">8.&nbsp;</b><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: large;"><b>Grand Blue</b></span></div><div><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: large;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/2/166124.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="320" data-original-width="225" height="320" src="https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/2/166124.jpg" width="225" /></a></div><br /></span><h2 style="background-color: white; border-color: rgb(190, 190, 190); border-style: solid; border-width: 0px 0px 1px; font-family: Verdana, Arial; font-size: 12px; margin: 4px 0px 5px; padding: 3px 0px;">Synopsis</h2><span itemprop="description" style="background-color: white; font-family: Verdana, Arial; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1.5em; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Among the seaside town of Izu's ocean waves and rays of shining sun, Iori Kitahara is just beginning his freshman year at Izu University.

Yet despite the wide range of possibilities, alchemy is not as all-powerful as most would believe. Human transmutation is strictly forbidden, and whoever attempts it risks severe consequences. Even so, siblings Edward and Alphonse Elric decide to ignore this great taboo and bring their mother back to life. Unfortunately, not only do they fail in resurrecting her, they also pay an extremely high price for their arrogance: Edward loses his left leg and Alphonse his entire body. Furthermore, Edward also gives up his right arm in order to seal his brother's soul into a suit of armor.<br /><br />Years later, the young alchemists travel across the country looking for the Philosopher's Stone, in the hopes of recovering their old bodies with its power. However, their quest for the fated stone also leads them to unravel far darker secrets than they could ever imagine.</span></div><br /><b><br /></b></span></div><div><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: large;"><b><br /></b></span></div><div><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: large;"><b><br /></b></span></div><div><b style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: x-large;">&nbsp;</b></div><div><b style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: x-large;">6.&nbsp;</b><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: large;"><b>Slam Dunk</b></span></div><div><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: large;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/2/258749.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="350" data-original-width="225" height="350" src="https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/2/258749.jpg" width="225" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><h2 style="background-color: white; border-color: rgb(190, 190, 190); border-style: solid; border-width: 0px 0px 1px; font-family: Verdana, Arial; font-size: 12px; margin: 4px 0px 5px; padding: 3px 0px; text-align: left;">Synopsis</h2><span itemprop="description" style="background-color: white; font-family: Verdana, Arial; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1.5em; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; text-align: left;">Hanamichi Sakuragi, a tall, boisterous teenager with flame-red hair and physical strength beyond his years, is eager to put an end to his rejection streak of 50 and finally score a girlfriend as he begins his first year of Shohoku High. However, his reputation for delinquency and destructiveness precedes him, and most of his fellow students subsequently avoid him like the plague. As his first day of school ends, he is left with two strong thoughts: "I hate basketball" and "I need a girlfriend."<br /><br />Haruko Akagi, ignorant of Hanamichi's history of misbehavior, notices his immense height and unwittingly approaches him, asking whether or not he likes basketball. Overcome by the fact that a girl is speaking to him, the red-haired giant blurts out a yes despite his true feelings. At the gym, Haruko asks if he can do a slam dunk. Though a complete novice, Hanamachi palms the ball and makes the leap...but overshoots, slamming his head into the backboard. Amazed by his near-inhuman physical abilities, Haruko quickly notifies the school's basketball captain of his feat. With this, Hanamichi is unexpectedly thrust into a world of competition for a girl he barely knows, but he soon discovers that there is perhaps more to basketball than he once thought.</span></div><br /><b><br /></b></span></div><div><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: large;"><b><br /></b></span></div><div><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: large;"><b><br /></b></span></div><div><b style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: x-large;">5.&nbsp;Monster</b></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/3/258224.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="319" data-original-width="225" height="319" src="https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/3/258224.jpg" width="225" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><h2 style="background-color: white; border-color: rgb(190, 190, 190); border-style: solid; border-width: 0px 0px 1px; font-family: Verdana, Arial; font-size: 12px; margin: 4px 0px 5px; padding: 3px 0px; text-align: left;">Synopsis</h2><span itemprop="description" style="background-color: white; font-family: Verdana, Arial; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1.5em; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; text-align: left;">Kenzou Tenma, a renowned Japanese neurosurgeon working in post-war Germany, faces a difficult choice: to operate on Johan Liebert, an orphan boy on the verge of death, or on the mayor of Düsseldorf.
